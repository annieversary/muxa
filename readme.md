# muxa

highly opinionated library built on top of [axum](https://docs.rs/axum) and [maud](https://github.com/annieversary/maud)

you probably should not use this, it's at a very early stage and it's highly specific to how i like to work, but you might find some code that's useful and that you can steal

there's a template if you for some reason do want to use this: [muxa-template](https://github.com/annieversary/muxa-template)
